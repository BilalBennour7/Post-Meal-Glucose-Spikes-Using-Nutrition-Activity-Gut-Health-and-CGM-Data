# Post-Meal-Glucose-Spikes-Using-Nutrition-Activity-Gut-Health-and-CGM-Data
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a meal will cause a post-prandial glucose spike (defined as a ≥30 mg/dL rise within 2 hours) using continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data, meal nutrition information, Fitbit activity, and individual health metrics
